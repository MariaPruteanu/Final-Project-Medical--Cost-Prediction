# Medical Cost Prediction

This project aims to predict individual medical costs using a dataset containing various attributes related to health insurance. The project focuses on analyzing features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and predicting the corresponding medical costs.

# Overview: 
• Seek insight from the dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis 
• Performed Data Processing, Data Engineering and Feature Transformation to prepare data before modeling 
• Built a model to predict Insurance Cost based on the features 
• Evaluated the model using various Performance Metrics like RMSE, R2, Testing Accuracy, Training Accuracy and MAE 

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project provides information about health insurance beneficiaries and their medical costs. It includes the following columns:

Variable	            Description
age	                    age of primary beneficiary
bmi	                    body mass index
children            	number of children covered by health insurance
smoker	                smoking
region	                the beneficiary's residential area in the US
charges	                individual medical costs billed by health insurance


# Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the medical costs for individuals based on their attributes. By analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and relationships, the model will provide insights into the factors influencing medical expenses.

# Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset will be prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees and random forests, will be explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model for cost prediction.

# Impact
Accurate medical cost prediction has significant implications for various stakeholders, including insurance companies, healthcare providers, and individuals. A reliable predictive model can assist insurance companies in assessing risks, determining appropriate premium rates, and managing resources efficiently. Healthcare providers can benefit from cost estimation to optimize resource allocation and budget planning. Additionally, individuals can gain insights into their potential medical expenses and make informed decisions regarding health insurance coverage.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into medical cost prediction and contribute to more accurate financial planning in the healthcare industry.

# Conclusion

Based on the predictive modeling, Linear Regression score , MAE Score , RMSE Score , R2 Score . 

Therefore,  algorithm --- is the best fitted model based on the training and testing accuracy.
